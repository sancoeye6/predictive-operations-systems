# Predictive Operations Systems

Simulation and real-time operational modeling engines designed to forecast outcomes, visualize system behavior, and optimize decisions before execution.

---

## Purpose
This repository contains interactive decision systems that model complex environments such as logistics networks, staffing ecosystems, financial throughput, and organizational growth.

These tools shift teams from reactive management → predictive control.

---

## Strategic Value
• Predict operational outcomes before committing resources  
• Reveal bottlenecks and hidden dependencies  
• Test decisions safely using simulation environments  
• Increase planning confidence through data-driven modeling  

---

## Core Capabilities
• Real-time system visualization  
• Scenario simulation engines  
• Resource forecasting logic  
• Organizational structure modeling  
• What-if decision testing  

---

## Architecture Principles
• Offline-first execution  
• Zero server dependency  
• Deterministic calculations first, AI optional  
• Instant feedback loops  
• Works in restricted or air-gapped environments  

---

## Included Systems

### Delivery Commander
Real-time logistics intelligence dashboard for route modeling, fleet visibility, and delay prediction.

### Institutional Factory
Enterprise architecture simulator for modeling departments, headcount scaling, and revenue velocity.

### Wedding Agent
Event command center for coordinating vendors, budgets, guests, and timelines inside a single reactive interface.

## Technology Stack
Vanilla JavaScript  
Leaflet.js  
Chart.js  
LocalStorage API  
Tailwind CSS  

---

## Design Philosophy
These systems are built using a **Simulation-First Engineering** approach:

Model → Test → Adjust → Deploy

Instead of deploying decisions and hoping they work, these tools let you test decisions before reality does.

---

## Use Cases
Operations Strategy  
Logistics Planning  
Organizational Forecasting  
Financial Modeling  
Project Coordination

## Repository Role in Portfolio
This repository demonstrates applied systems engineering, predictive modeling, and simulation-driven decision design.

It represents the **forecasting layer** of the architecture portfolio.
